### Text theming

### Text cursor theme

	# Supported values: bar, block, underscore
	text-cursor-style = bar

	# Color of the text cursor
	# If unspecified, defaults to the same as input-color

	# Thickness of the bar and underscore text cursors.
	# If unspecified, defaults to a font-dependent value when
	# text-cursor-style = underscore, or to 2 otherwise.

### Text layout
	# Prompt to display.
	prompt-text = "run: "

	# Extra horizontal padding between prompt and input.

### Window positioning
	# The name of the output to appear on. An empty string will use the

	# A value of -1 means ignore exclusive zones completely.
	# A value of 0 will move tofi out of the way of other windows' zones.
	# A value greater than 0 will set that much space as an exclusive zone.

### Behaviour
	# Hide the mouse cursor.

	# Show a text cursor in the input field.
	text-cursor = false

	# Sort results by number of usages in run and drun modes.
	history = true

	# Specify an alternate file to read and store history information
	# from / to. This shouldn't normally be needed, and is intended to
	# facilitate the creation of custom modes.
	# history-file = /path/to/histfile

	# Select the matching algorithm used. If normal, substring matching is
	# used, weighted to favour matches closer to the beginning of the
	# string. If prefix, only substrings at the beginning of the string are
	# matched. If fuzzy, searching is performed via a simple fuzzy matching
	# algorithm.
	#
	# Supported values: normal, prefix, fuzzy
	#matching-algorithm = fuzzy

	# If true, require a match to allow a selection to be made. If false,
	# making a selection with no matches will print input to stdout.
	# In drun mode, this is always true.
	require-match = true

	# If true, automatically accept a result if it is the only one
	# remaining. If there's only one result on startup, window creation is
	# skipped altogether.
	auto-accept-single = false

	# If true, typed input will be hidden, and what is displayed (if
	# anything) is determined by the hidden-character option.
	hide-input = false

	# Replace displayed input characters with a character. If the empty
	# string is given, input will be completely hidden.
	# This option only has an effect when hide-input is set to true.
	hidden-character = "*"

	# If true, use physical keys for shortcuts, regardless of the current
	# keyboard layout. If false, use the current layout's keys.
	#physical-keybindings = true

	# Instead of printing the selected entry, print the 1-based index of
	# the selection. This option has no effect in run or drun mode. If
	# require-match is set to false, non-matching input will still result
	# in the input being printed.
	#print-index = false

	# If true, directly launch applications on selection when in drun mode.
	# Otherwise, just print the command line to stdout.
	drun-launch = false

	# This option has no effect if drun-launch is set to true.

	# terminal = foot

	# Delay keyboard initialisation until after the first draw to screen.
	# This option is experimental, and will cause tofi to miss keypresses
	# for a short time after launch. The only reason to use this option is
	# performance on slow systems.

	# If false, create a lock file on startup to prevent multiple instances
	# from running simultaneously.

### Inclusion

	# Configs can be split between multiple files, and then included
	# within each other.
